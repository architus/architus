    Purge a channel of messages until a specific message is reached

    Purges all messages sent after the message corresponding to the
    message id of the user who sent that message. If the optional last
    parameter is set to true or True then deleted messages will not be
    limited to just the one author but included all messages in the relevant
    time period. Any non "true" or "True" value passed in at the end will
    default to False.

    Only searches the past 10000 messages sent in a channel for which to delete.
    If more than 10000 messages have been sent between the given message's id and
    when this command is run, then all of that user's messages may not get
    deleted.

    Architus has already started to go through the message history, all messages
    from the target message's author (up to 10,000) in the channel will be deleted.
    This race condition should have no effect on the command's behavior if
    all messages are going to be deleted.
