//! Includes a two-stage pipeline where Gateway lifecycle events
//! are sent through a shared mpsc channel to a `connection::Tracker`,
//! which stores a per-guild connection status as well as an overall connection
//! to the Rabbit MQ queue and Discord Gateway.
//! This `connection::Tracker` re-emits `Event` structs that represent rising and falling edges
//! as guilds come online/offline, in addition to heartbeat messages to maintain an online guild.
//! These events are routed through the `active_guilds` module, which contains logic
//! for periodically polling the feature-gate service and noting the guilds with indexing enabled.
//! It filters the raw `Event`s from `connection::Tracker` based on the guilds with indexing enabled,
//! only allowing events for those that have it to be forwarded
//! (in addition to generating rising/falling edge events
//! when it detects an online guild has enabled/disabled indexing).
